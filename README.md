# NodeNote

NodeNote is a versatile, graph-based note-taking and file organizing tool developed with Tauri and Rust. It is designed to manage and visualize data in a non-linear fashion, allowing users to create complex relationships between notes and files beyond traditional hierarchical folder structures.

## Planned Features

- [ ] **Graph-Based Organization:** Manage your notes and files using a graph structure, allowing for flexible and interconnected data relationships.
- [ ] **General Node Collections:** Nodes on the graph will contain a markdown file for primary note-taking, but can also hold other file types and a subgraph.
  - [ ] **File Support:** Native rendering of many common file types such as .md, .txt, .png, and .jpg.
  - [ ] **Editing Support:** Native support for editing common text based file types such as .md or .txt.
  - [ ] **Link Nodes:** Add directed edges between nodes to represent relationships.
- [ ] **Graph Analysis Tools:** Analyze the graph of your notes using analysis methods such as finding the shortest path between nodes or finding communities.
